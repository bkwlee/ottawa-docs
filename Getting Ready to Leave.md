## Getting Ready to Leave

### Early the day you leave

- [ ] Clean out things in the fridge which will go bad
- [ ] Throw your bedding in the wash (if you don't have time, just leave it in the washing machine without starting it)
- [ ] **If** you used the coffee maker, empty the grounds by pulling the drip tray out of the machine

### Before you leave

- [ ] Take out the garbage, and toss it down the chute (across the hall)
- [ ] Turn off the hot water heater, to do so, go to the breaker by the laundry machines, and turn off the one marked `hot water`
- [ ] Turn off the A/C by switching the old looking thermostat in the living room to `OFF`
- [ ] Turn off the A/C fan by switching the dial beside the breaker to `OFF`
- [ ] Turn down the heat in all of the rooms to around `14Â°C` or so
- [ ] Take down the recycling to the garage

  	The easiest way to get here is to go down the stairs beside the elevator, and go down two flights. Then, once inside the garage, turn right.

  	- Recycling is sorted by paper & cardboard, and everything else.
