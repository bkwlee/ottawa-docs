# Other Recommendations

There are some non-restaurant recommendations for things to do or places to shop at

## Stores

- La Bottega (upscale Italian grocer, good selection but a bit pricy) 

- Loblaws is a ~12 min walk away, it's big and has a decent selection

- The LCBO nearby ~8 min away is good, they have a basement with a fantastic selection of wine & liquor 

## Things to do

- Gatineau park has some great walks / hikes when the weather is nice

- Camp fortune is close by (~25 min away) and is similar to Blue Mountain
