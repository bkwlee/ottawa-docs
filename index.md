## Overview

Welcome! Make yourself at home!

### Getting the A/C working

!!! info

    Because this A/C system uses chilled water from the building, it does not get much cooler than ~22Â°C, and may not even get that cool during extremely hot days. It also takes a while to cool down, though upping the fan speed can help increase air flow in the unit.

The A/C system here is a little complex, and requires two steps.

1.  Turn on the Honeywell thermostat in the living room to `cool`

2.  Go to the laundry closet in the hallway. On the left side beside the breaker, there is a dial. This controls the A/C fan. Switch it to a non-off position

    !!! tip

        This dial controls the A/C fan, but it can also be used to increase airflow when the A/C is off as well

### Home automations

- The light against the back wall of the bedroom is motion activated between the hours of `12am` and `7am`, and will turn on for `4 minutes` when activated.

  If this is undesirable, you can either

  - turn off the light,

    or

  - turn the motion sensor so it faces the wall, then turn the light back on, and it should act normally.

- When using the TV after sunset, the light in the corner will fade on, and will automatically turn itself off a few minutes after the TV is turned off. You don't need to manually turn off the light unless you want it off :smile:

### Nighttime safety

The area is generally pretty safe, however some of the streets can be a bit unpleasant to walk down late at night. While there is a semi-permanent police presence on Cumberland right around the condo building, some of the other streets in the area can get a bit more rowdy.

Generally, avoiding the areas marked in red below after dark is recommended, as while they are safe, some more rowdy characters can hang out in these areas.
