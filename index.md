### Getting the A/C working

The A/C system here is a little complex, and requires two steps.

1.  Turn on the Honeywell thermostat in the living room to `cool`

2.  Go to the laundry closet in the hallway. On the left side beside the breaker, there is a dial. This controls the A/C fan. Switch it to a non-off position

    !!! tip

        This dial controls the A/C fan, but it can also be used to increase airflow when the A/C is off as well

!!! info

    Because this A/C system uses chilled water from the building, it does not get much cooler than ~22Â°C, and may not even get that cool during extremely hot days. It also takes a while to cool down, though upping the fan speed can help increase air flow in the unit.

### Home automations

There are some automations in the master bedroom which you may want to be aware of. 

- The light against the back wall of the bedroom is motion activated between the hours of `12am` and `7am`, and will turn on for `4 minutes` when activated.
  
  If this is undesirable, you can either
    - turn off the light,

    or

    -  turn the motion sensor so it faces the wall, then turn the light back on, and it should act normally.
